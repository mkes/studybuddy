# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Google Calendar Integration is an enhancement to the StudyTracker application that allows parents and observers to sync their student's assignments and quizzes to Google Calendar. This feature provides automated calendar events with reminders for upcoming due dates, helping parents stay informed about their student's academic schedule and deadlines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to connect both my Google Calendar account and my student's Google Calendar account, so that assignments are synced to both calendars for better coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the student dashboard THEN the system SHALL display calendar connection options for both parent and student accounts
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect My Calendar" THEN the system SHALL initiate Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for the parent account
3. WHEN a user enters student's Google email THEN the system SHALL provide option to send calendar sync invitation to the student
4. WHEN a student accepts the invitation THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow for the student's Google account
5. WHEN either account completes Google authentication THEN the system SHALL store access tokens securely and display connection status
6. WHEN accounts are connected THEN the system SHALL show connection status for both parent and student calendars with individual disconnect options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to automatically sync upcoming assignments to both my calendar and my student's calendar, so that we both receive notifications and reminders about due dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parent and/or student calendars are connected THEN the system SHALL automatically create calendar events for assignments with due dates in connected calendars
2. WHEN creating calendar events THEN the system SHALL include assignment title, course name, due date/time, and points possible
3. WHEN creating calendar events THEN the system SHALL set different default reminders (parent: 24h, 2h; student: 2h, 30min before due date)
4. WHEN assignments are updated in Canvas THEN the system SHALL update corresponding Google Calendar events in both calendars
5. WHEN assignments are completed/graded THEN the system SHALL optionally mark calendar events as completed or remove them from both calendars
6. WHEN only one calendar is connected THEN the system SHALL sync only to the connected calendar

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to control which assignments get synced to my calendar, so that I can customize notifications based on my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses calendar settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter which assignments to sync
2. WHEN configuring sync settings THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by course, assignment type (quiz, homework, project), and due date range
3. WHEN configuring sync settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom reminder times (1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 1 week)
4. WHEN sync settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future calendar events
5. WHEN a user disables sync for specific courses THEN the system SHALL remove existing events for those courses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want calendar events to be created in dedicated calendars for both my account and my student's account, so that assignments are organized separately from personal events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN first connecting parent Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated calendar named "Student Assignments - [Student Name]" in parent's account
2. WHEN first connecting student Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated calendar named "My Assignments" in student's account
3. WHEN creating assignment events THEN the system SHALL add them to the appropriate dedicated calendars in both accounts
4. WHEN managing multiple students THEN the system SHALL create separate calendars for each student in the parent's account
5. WHEN a user disconnects calendar sync THEN the system SHALL offer option to keep or delete the dedicated calendars
6. WHEN calendar events are created THEN the system SHALL use consistent color coding and formatting across both calendars

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to see calendar sync status and manage sync errors, so that I can ensure assignments are properly synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar sync occurs THEN the system SHALL display last sync time and status on the dashboard
2. WHEN sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN Google Calendar API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with retry logic
4. WHEN Google Calendar access is revoked externally THEN the system SHALL detect and prompt for re-authentication
5. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual sync option and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to easily set up calendar sync for my student by providing their Google email, so that they can also receive assignment notifications in their own calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up calendar integration THEN the system SHALL provide a field to enter the student's Google email address
2. WHEN student email is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the email format and send a calendar sync invitation
3. WHEN student receives invitation THEN the system SHALL provide a secure link for the student to authorize calendar access
4. WHEN student authorizes access THEN the system SHALL link the student's calendar to the parent's StudyTracker account
5. WHEN student email is not provided THEN the system SHALL allow parent-only calendar sync
6. WHEN student later wants to disconnect THEN the system SHALL provide option for student to revoke their own calendar access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want the calendar integration to be secure and respect privacy for both my account and my student's account, so that we can trust the application with our Google account access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing Google OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt tokens for both parent and student accounts and store them securely
2. WHEN requesting Google Calendar permissions THEN the system SHALL request only necessary scopes (calendar read/write) for each account
3. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive token information for either account
4. WHEN a user account is deleted THEN the system SHALL revoke all associated Google Calendar access tokens for both parent and student
5. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all Google OAuth redirects and API calls
6. WHEN student is under 18 THEN the system SHALL ensure parent consent is maintained for student calendar access
