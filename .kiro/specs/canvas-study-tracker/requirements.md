# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StudyTracker is a web application that integrates with Canvas LMS to help parents and observers track their students' assignments, grades, and academic progress. The system provides a centralized dashboard where parents can view assignment details, due dates, submission status, and grades across all courses for their observed students.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to authenticate using my Canvas API token, so that I can securely access my observed students' academic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a form to input Canvas API token
2. WHEN a user submits a valid Canvas API token THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the students page
3. WHEN a user submits an invalid Canvas API token THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store the token securely in the browser localStorage
5. WHEN an authenticated user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL use Bearer authentication with the stored token

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to select which student to view, so that I can track assignments for each of my observed students individually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the students page THEN the system SHALL retrieve all observed students from Canvas API
2. WHEN students are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display them in a dropdown selection interface
3. WHEN a user selects a student THEN the system SHALL navigate to that student's dashboard
4. IF a user has multiple observed students THEN the system SHALL support switching between them
5. WHEN the Canvas API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want to view my student's assignments with grades and status, so that I can monitor their academic progress and identify areas needing attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a student dashboard THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch and display assignments with grades
2. WHEN assignments are displayed THEN the system SHALL show assignment title, course name, due date, points possible, current grade, and status
3. WHEN assignments are listed THEN the system SHALL order them chronologically in descending order (newest first)
4. WHEN displaying assignment status THEN the system SHALL show visual badges: Submitted (Green), Missing (Red), Late (Yellow), Overdue (Red), Pending (Blue)
5. WHEN a user wants to filter assignments THEN the system SHALL support date range filtering with default range of Aug 1 - Sep 30, 2025

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want the system to automatically sync assignment data, so that I always see the most current information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL automatically sync assignments and grades from Canvas API
2. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL retrieve assignments and grades in a single Canvas API call for performance
3. WHEN assignment data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache it in the local PostgreSQL database
4. WHEN Canvas API rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL display updated assignment information within 10 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can access my student's information quickly on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assignment list loads THEN the system SHALL complete loading within 3 seconds
2. WHEN Canvas API sync occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds
3. WHEN displaying assignments THEN the system SHALL handle up to 100 assignments per student
4. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a parent/observer, I want my data to be secure and the system to be reliable, so that I can trust the application with my student's academic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing database credentials THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for configuration
2. WHEN Canvas API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle downtime gracefully and display appropriate messages
3. WHEN database connection failures occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and report them appropriately
4. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL handle it without crashing the application
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL configure CORS properly for localhost access
